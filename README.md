# Terraform

The missing WinRM Terraform examples.  Feel free create an issue or pull request if want to add an example or have a 
better or more secure way to accomplish something. The more feedback, the better for me and everyone else. ;-)

## Examples

- `aws-winrm-instance` - Shows how to use `user_data` to configure WinRM, open firewall, and set the Administrator 
password for AWS Window 2012R2 Base image.
- `aws-winrm-asg-provision` - Shows how to provision via Chef an ASG server when an instance comes up.
